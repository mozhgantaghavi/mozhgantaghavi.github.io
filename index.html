Over time, I have become increasingly motivated to study machine learning and data-driven approaches, recognising how these tools can translate mathematical ideas into practical solutions for real-world problems.</p> <p>My current work focuses on integrating mathematics and optimization with AI-based techniques to better understand complex systems. I enjoy tackling problems from both analytical and computational perspectives and am motivated by the challenge of transforming abstract concepts into methods that generate insight, prediction, or impact.</p> </body></html>
