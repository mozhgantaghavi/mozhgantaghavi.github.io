I am a self-motivated, lifelong learner, problem-solver, and researcher with a background in **applied mathematics**, driven by a deep interest in connecting mathematical theory with modern computational methods and artificial intelligence. Over time, I have become increasingly motivated to study machine learning and data-driven approaches, recognising how these tools can translate mathematical ideas into practical solutions for real-world problems.

My current work focuses on integrating mathematics and optimization with AI-based techniques to better understand complex systems. I enjoy tackling problems from both analytical and computational perspectives and am motivated by the challenge of transforming abstract concepts into methods that generate insight, prediction, or impact.
