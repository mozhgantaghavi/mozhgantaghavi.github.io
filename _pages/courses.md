Beyond my mathematics coursework, I have pursued independent studies in **programming**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**. This journey began with strengthening my programming skills, especially in **Python**, which provided the foundation I needed to move into the field of **artificial intelligence**. I then expanded my studies to a broader range of machine learning and deep learning topics, including **supervised and unsupervised** methods, regression and classification techniques, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and neural network architectures. I worked hands-on with these concepts using **scikit-learn** and **PyTorch**. Together, this multi-layered learning experience has helped me build a solid theoretical understanding, solid coding proficiency, and the ability to apply computational and data-driven methods to complex problems.


**Courses with Certificates**

1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
    Coursera, Stanford University — 2023
   
This course strengthened my motivation to study **machine learning** by introducing practical **Python** libraries such as **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib** for developing and training models. It focused on supervised learning methods, including linear and logistic regression, as well as the convergence properties of gradient descent. The course emphasized practical applications and demonstrated how these techniques can be used to address real-world machine learning challenges effectively.

2.**MATLAB Programming**
  Maktabkhooneh — 2020

Completed a practical, project-based introduction to **MATLAB**. Gained proficiency in working with arrays, matrices, functions, conditional logic, loops, and file operations. Applied foundational programming concepts to small simulation and analysis projects.
