My research integrates applied mathematics, numerical analysis, and machine learning to study complex problems. I combine analytical and numerical methods to translate theoretical concepts into practical solutions. To support this work, I use Python and MATLAB to approximate solutions, develop models, and analyze complex datasets, allowing me to apply both numerical and data-driven techniques effectively.

**1. Mathematical Modeling and Applied Mathematics**

I have a strong foundation in applied mathematics and mathematical modeling. My previous research has focused on calculus of variations, a field that studies finding functions optimizing energy functionals, and numerical methods to approximate solutions. This research is fundamental for understanding physical systems and structures, formulating them as variational problems. In particular, I have studied the Skyrme energy functional in, analyzing topological classes of maps called generalized twists and their relationship with the Euler–Lagrange equations. I also applied advanced numerical techniques, including Fourier–Legendre spectral methods, to approximate solutions efficiently.

**2. Computational Modeling and Numerical Analysis**

My research also includes computational modeling using zero-dimensional lumped-parameter models to simulate complex systems. Specifically, I have worked with vessel models coupled with Windkessel terminal models to study the dynamics of blood flow, pressure, and volume. These models are formulated as systems of ordinary differential equations and solved using numerical methods, such as the forward Euler method. I have also used synthetic data to calibrate the models and estimate key parameters, applying optimization techniques to ensure accurate and reliable simulations. This work has strengthened my ability to translate theoretical concepts into computational frameworks and gain predictive insights into real-world systems.

**3. Machine Learning and Data-Driven Approaches**

Building on my mathematical and computational foundation, I am currently focused on bridging the gap between machine learning methods and mathematics to analyze complex datasets. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances my analytical skills but also prepares me to tackle current challenges in data science. I am particularly interested in neural networks, especially physics-informed neural networks, applied to problems in interdisciplinary areas such as biology, healthcare, environmental science, and engineering. My goal is to develop models that are understandable, robust, and capable of learning efficiently from structured or limited data, addressing challenges where trust and reproducibility are critical. Prospectively, I aim to develop frameworks that connect theoretical concepts, computational methods, and machine learning to practical applications. I am motivated to create models and tools resulting in more reliable predictions and foster advancements across various fields. My ultimate goal is to translate abstract mathematical concepts into real-world solutions with measurable impact.
